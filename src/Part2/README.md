# Part 2

We need another calculator programme. This one needs to do addition. Try using the following command to create the
necessary class:

`./vendor/bin/phpspec describe 'PhpSpecKata\Part2\Calculator'`

Then run PhpSpec with:

`./vendor/bin/phpspec run`

Tell PhpSpec to help you, then familiarise yourself with the files created.

Write a spec that tests a method called `add()`, but don't write the production code yet. Run PhpSpec again.

Produce a working calculator that can do addition.
