# Part 3

A shopping basket class uses a calculator to add the price together. You get free shipping if your items cost more than
Â£25.

The production code is already done, but more tests are needed. We have one spec for the basket, describing one of its
behaviours.

Look at how it uses mock objects. Try writing another test, for its other core behaviour. Use the mock object in the
same way.
